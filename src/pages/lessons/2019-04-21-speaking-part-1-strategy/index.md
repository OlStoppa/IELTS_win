People often refer to part 1 of the IELTS speaking test as 'the warm up' beacause the questions are all on familiar topics such as home, family, work and interests. In spite of this, many IELTS candidates find it difficult to give a natural but extended answer. 

It's very tempting to give the kind of short answer that would be perfectly acceptable in normal conversation.

> Q: Do you like going to the cinema?   
>A: Yes, I love it.



Alas, for the purposes of IELTS test, **this answer is too short** and doesn't allow us to demonstrate the level of fluency needed to get a high band score.

With a desire to show their level of fluency and extend their answer, some candidates will keep speaking until they are stopped by the examiner.

> A: Yes, I love to go to the cinema. I went last Thursday with my girlfriend. We saw a new movie. It was about a boy who becomes a wizard, and eventually he saves the world. He defeats many evil enemies in fantastic ways but still has to hide the fact that he's a wizard from his parents.

Although this answer demonstrates a high level of fluency, with this approach, it is very easy to go **off topic** and start to become incoherent.

A few years ago, I stumbled upon this nice strategy that helps test-takers give answers of an appropriate length with great content.

### The REDS Strategy

The REDS system gives you four ways to answer the question.

>**R**easons  
>**E**xample  
>**D**escription  
>**S**peculate

When answering a part 1 question, you can choose **one** of these options. For example, when answering the previous question I could say: 

>Q: Do you like going to the cinema?
>
>**Reasons**  
>Yes. I love watching movies at the cinema because there is always a great atmosphere. I think it's great to watch a film in the company of lots of other people who are as excited about seeing it as I am.
>
>**Example**  
>Absolutely! I've been going since I was a child. I remember when my father took me for the first time. We saw a Disney movie and it was fantastic.
>
>**Details**  
>Sure. There's a movie theatre very close to where I live so I go most weekends with my family. It's a great way to forget your troubles for a couple of hours.
>
>**Speculate**  
>Yes, it's great. I don't have the opportunity to go very much right now as I'm busy with university. Perhaps I'll have more time to enjoy watching movies after I graduate in the summer.

Use this strategy when practicing for the speaking test so when it comes to test day you are comfortable picking an option and coming up with an appropriate answer as quickly as possible. It's clear to see how with this simple technique, it's easy to give an an extended answer that shows a high level of fluency but that still sounds natural.
