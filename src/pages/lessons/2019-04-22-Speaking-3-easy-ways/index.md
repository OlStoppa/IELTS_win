The speaking part of the IELTS test can be often be the most stressful. Trying to demonstrate your speaking skill on the spot while thinking of things to say and examples is taxing and test-takers often lose sight of what will get them the high band score that they require.

It's important to remember how the speaking test is actually marked. If you keep this in mind, there are some tricks that can be practiced that are likely to come into play during your interview that may allow you to push your band score up a notch.

### 1.An Easy Way To Expand Your Grammatical Range
Grammatical range is a large part of the speaking test grade. Test-takers sometimes find that the interview flies by so quickly that they don't get a chance to use as many different grammar patterns as they should. Or, that they concentrate too much on trying to use a particular grammar pattern and end up making mistakes.
Here is a way you can practice using more difficult grammar.

### I'd never been so.....

A great tactic for the speaking test is using examples and telling stories from your own experience but I've found that candidates often get stuck using only the past simple tense. I advise my students to practice using the **past perfect tense** when telling a story, like this:

>When I was six, I got a bike for my birthday. **I'd never been so excited.**

>My little sister drew pictures on the wall. **I'd never seen my mother so angry.**

### 2.An Easy Way to Sound More Natural

Sounding more natural and more like a native speaker is the long term goal of most language learners. It is also a great way to get a better score in your speaking test, but there are of elements to practice. Here are a couple of things that you can start practicing right now:

### Use Contractions

When you listen to native speakers talk you'll hear that they always use the contracted form in general conversation.

> They are -> **They're**  \
> I had eaten -> **I'd eaten** \
> He did not -> **He didn't** 

Generally, if there is a contracted form, you should use it.

### 3.An Easy Way to Use an Idiom

I usually caution IELTS candidates not to spend too much time learning idioms when they are preparing for the test. Idioms are great and if you can use them naturally and in the right context they can boost your score a lot, but often you won't have an opportunity to use the ones you've spent time learning in the speaking test so it can be a waste of time. However, there is one idiom that is very useful in situations that you have to give opinions without time to think them through, just like parts 1 and 3 of the speaking test.

>**Off the top of my head...** (without careful thought or investigation)

This idiom is used by native speakers all the time when they need to give an opinion on something they haven't thought about much before. Not only is it very natural and the examiner will recognise that you have used idiomatic speech, but it can also be used to gain some thinking time before you answer the question.

>Q: What are the advantages of shopping online? \
>A: That's an interesting one. **Off the top of my head**, I'd say the main benefit of shopping online is that you can compare prices very easily.

Don't use it more than once in the test as it's not a good idea to repeat things but used once it can really help you out.

Generally, the best way to get a high score on the IELTS test is to have a good level of English proficiency and that takes a lot of hard work and practice but little tips like this can be a great helping hand.
