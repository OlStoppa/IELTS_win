The speaking part of the IELTS test can be often be the most stressful. Trying to demonstrate your speaking skill on the spot while thinking of things to say and examples is taxing and test-takers often lose sight of what will get you the high band score that they require.

It's important to remember how the speaking test is actually marked. If you keep this in mind, there are some tricks that can be practiced that are likely to come into play during your interview that may allow you to push your band score up a notch.

### An Easy Way To Expand Your Grammatical Range
Grammatical range is a large part of the speaking test grade. Test-takers sometimes find that the interview flies by so quickly that they don't get a chance to use as many different grammar patterns as they should. Or, that they concentrate too much on trying to use a particular grammar pattern and end up making mistakes.
Here is a way you can practice using more difficult grammar.

### I'd never been so.....

A great tactic for the speaking test is using examples and telling stories from your own experience but I've found that candidates often get stuck using only the past simple tense. I advise my students to practice using the **past perfect tense** when telling a story, like this:

>When I was six, I got a bike for my birthday. **I'd never been so excited.**

>My little sister drew pictures on the wall. **I'd never seen my mother so angry.**

### An Easy Way to Sound More Natural

Sounding more natural and more like a native speaker is the long term goal of most language learners. It is also a great way to get a better score in your speaking test, but there are of elements to practice. Here are a couple of things that you can start practicing right now:

### Use Contractions

When you listen to native speakers talk you'll hear that they always use the contracted form in general conversation.

> They are -> **They're**  \
> I had eaten -> **I'd eaten** \
> He did not -> **He didn't** 

Generally, if there is a contracted form, you should use it.
